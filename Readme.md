# Introduction
These API tests are written using [chakram](https://github.com/dareid/chakram) which gives a BDD style of writing tests making 
the tests more human readable.

## Prerequisite
1. [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) 

## Instructions for running tests
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to `dazn-backend` folder.
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm test`

## Reports
1. This framework uses `mochawesome` for reporting , please find the `mocha`reports under `mochawesome-report` folder.

## FootNotes:

Sometimes the API can be really slow to respond(especially the first time) . If this happens
please re run the tests.
