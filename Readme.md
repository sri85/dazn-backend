#Weather API tests
These API tests are written using chakram and mocha which gives a BDD style of writing tests making it more human readable.

## Prerequisite
1. [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) 

## Instructions for running tests

1. Navigate to `api-tests` folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm test`

## Reports
1. This framework uses `mochawesome` for reporting , please find the `mocha`reports under `mochawesome-report` folder

##FootNotes:

Sometimes the API can be really slow to respond(especially the first time) . If this happens
please re run the tests.
